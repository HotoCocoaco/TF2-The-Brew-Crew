# TF2-The-Brew-Crew
All of my TF2 server code

# Why
I'm retiring from TF2 server hosting, so I figured it would be nice to give back. In this repo is quite literally *all* of the customly written code and plugins that I have used over the years.

# What
Basically, you can use whatever you find interesting here. I don't care. You can copy and paste my server if that's what you want to do. All I ask is that you don't try and market or sell it as if it's your own code.

# Content
I'll do my best to summarize. A lot of plugins I have listed here are old and no longer used so the odds of them working as a drag n' drop is probably 0.

### Where are the models and stuff?

Hopefully here https://brewcrew.tf/tf/

If that 404s anytime soon then I'll hopefully put everything in this repo or in a Mega link or something.

### Plugins

Once again worth reiterating that these plugins will probably take some elbow grease to get to compile. My workspace is/was a mess. Once again, I don't care what you do with them.
